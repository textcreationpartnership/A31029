            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAVING Methodized and Explained the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Infants, by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chain of Thought, I was prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to reflect upon the Law as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Parents: And I had ſome reaſon to conceive and hope, that a Treatiſe of this nature (having been never hitherto deſignedly peruſed) might meet with an Entertainment agreeable. It is a Subject ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:98535:3"/> that we ſhall find ſomething or other relating to <hi>Baron and Feme</hi> in almoſt every Folio of our Law-Books, either in reſpect of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, Acts Judicial, Acts <hi>in Pais,</hi> Teſtaments, Actions or Pleadings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which I have here Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodized, Explained or Corrected, as occaſion lead me to it.</p>
            <p>I have herein, conſidered <hi>Baron and Feme</hi> in all the Circumſtances of Life, from the Solemnization of Marriage to the Divorce, and have not omitted thoſe Collateral By-blows, (the Title of <hi>Baſtardy</hi> making a conſiderable figure in our Books<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and the Variety of the Matter made me ſome Attonement for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>I have been ſomething tedious in conſidering what Alterations are made by the Intermarriage as to Eſtates, Leaſes, Chattels and Actions,
<pb facs="tcp:98535:3"/> and what Things of the Wife ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Husband by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage, or not; and what Acts, Charges or Forfeitures made or committed by the Husband, ſhall bind the Wife after his Death, as well knowing that they are of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe, and conſequently care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be examined.</p>
            <p>But I have not been over-ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in Attornments, Diſſeiſins, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters and Warranties, and ſuch like, which have a reſpect to real Actions concerning Feme Coverts; our Law having been much abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and altered in ſuch Caſes, and our Settlements and Deeds of Truſt as they are now framed, will ſtrike off, and abate many of the Moot Caſes; and whoever has a mind to be curious about them, may with great Satisfaction conſult the firſt Inſtitutes, where they are largely
<pb facs="tcp:98535:4"/> and moſt excellently handled. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I have not totally omitted them, but have touched on ſome Caſes which may be obvious in Practice, and by which an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-diſpoſed Student may improve his Notions, without heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up other Caſes or Points, one whereof perhaps may not be ſtarted in his Practice once in an Age. Only in the Section where and in what Caſes <hi>Baron and Feme</hi> ſhall take by Intereſt or Moyeties, I have been more exact for that it is a curious and uſeful Learning.</p>
            <p>As to what Acts or Contracts made by the Wife ſhall bind the Husband, the Reſolutions of our Books have not been very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent till that great Caſe (in point of Conſequence I mean) of <hi>Scott</hi> and <hi>Manby,</hi> which was ſolemnly debated and ſetled in the <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Chamber
<pb facs="tcp:98535:4"/> by as Learned Judges as ever ſat at one time in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> Which long Arguments I have abridged and reduced to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>We likewiſe find our Books have been very wavering about <hi>Baron and Feme's</hi> Joinder in Action; but I have brought them into ſeven or eight Rules, by which a Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mind may eaſily be directed how to adviſe in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            <p>And under every ſeveral Action brought by or againſt Husband and Wife, I have ſhewed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Declaring and Pleading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Action, which makes the Chapters of Declarations and Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings much ſhorter than they would have been.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98535:5"/>
            <p>As for the Faults herein commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I have no way but <hi>(me ipſum tegere)</hi> to ſhelter my ſelf under the <hi>Coverture</hi> of your Candor and Ingenuity.</p>

                  <p>A Feme Covert in our Books is often compared to an Infant,<note place="margin">Wherein a Feme Covert and an Infant differ.</note> both being perſons diſabled in the Law, but they differ much; an Infant is capable of doing any Act for his own advantage, ſo is not a Feme Covert. A Leaſe made by an Infant without Rent is not void, but voidable; but its void in the caſe of a Feme Covert. If a Feme Covert enter into Bond, <hi>Non est factum</hi> may be pleaded to it; but if an Infant enter into. Bond he muſt plead the ſpecial matter that he was under Age. An Infant may bind himſelf for conveniences, as neceſſaries for himſelf and Family, and the Law giveth him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo to bind himſelf; but a Feme Coven cannot do ſo without the conſent actual or implied of the Husband, becauſe thereby ſhe is to bind ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath all the property in her Eſtate, as was the Opinion of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> in <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Manby</hi>'s Caſe.

                  <head>What Acts the Husband may do to the Wife, and the Wife to the Husband, though they are but one perſon in Law.</head>
                  <p>Baron and Feme are commonly ſaid to be one perſon in Law; the conſequents of which are, that a Man cannot grant Lands and Tenements to his Wife; and alſo if a joint Eſtate be made of Lands to Baron and Feme and to a third perſon,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 112.</note> in this Caſe the Husband and Wife ſhall have but a moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for this reaſon alſo, if the Husband diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the Land of his Wife and takes back an Eſtate to him and his Wife, the Wife is remitted, and ſo is the Husband, though he cannot ſay ſo; for ſhe cannot be remitted but the Husband alſo muſt be remitted, for they are one perſon in Law,<note place="margin">Cro.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Vide plus ſub Titulo</hi> Moyeties.</p>
                  <p>Though Baron and Feme be but one perſon in Law ſo as neither of them can give any Eſtate or Intereſt to the other, yet if a Charter of Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be made to the Wife, the Husband, as Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Feoffor, may make Livery to the Wife; ſo a Feme Covert that hath power to ſell Land by Will may ſell the ſame to her Husband, becauſe they are but Inſtruments to others, and the Eſtate paſſeth from the Feoffor or Deviſor, 1 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 188.</p>
                  <p>Though our Law makes the Woman ſubject to the Husband, yet he may not kill her but it is Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he may not beat her, but ſhe may pray the peace, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.1.

               <argument>
                  <p>The Nature and Reaſon of Remitter. What Act ſhall be a Remitter to the Wife. Remitter wrought by a voidable Eſtate. Remainder expectant on an Eſtate for Life works no Remitter. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what Acts and Alienations by the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the Wife ſhall be remitted. Of Remitter by Acceptance. Where the Wife being remitted during the Coverture may after the death of her Husband wave the Remitter, and where not. No Diſagreement of the Husband ſhall deveſt the Remitter, and the Reaſon. Where a Warranty deſcending on an Infant or a Feme Covert ſhall be a Bar, and where not. Where the Baron and Feme ſhall be Joyntenants; and where by Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties, and where by Moieties, with ſeveral Caſes to illustrate that curious Learning; and how it was at Common Law, and how it is now by the Statute of Uſes.</p>

Now as upon Re-entry in ſuch Caſe where the Entry is lawful, ſhe is remitted; ſo where an Eſtate is conveyed to her, and is in her, though by the Statute her Entry being lawful, ſhe ſhall be adjudged in of her beſt Eſtate, her Remitter being <hi>Intratio legitima,</hi> though not <hi>actualis, Heb.</hi> 255, 256.</p>

                  <p>What Acts done, or Contracts made by the Wife, ſhall bind the Husband, or not. Six Reſolutions of the Court in <hi>Scott</hi> and <hi>Manby</hi>'s Caſe, as to that Point, and other Caſes relating thereto, and the manner of laying the Action, and declaring therein.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REgularly the Contracts of Femes Covert are void, in as much as their Powers are transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their husbands by the Intermarriage, <hi>Sid.</hi> 120.

It is ſaid in 1 <hi>Roll</hi>'s <hi>Abr.</hi> 351. If a wife buy things for her neceſſary Apparel without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the husband, yet the husband ſhall be bound to pay it, Sir <hi>Tho. Gardner</hi>'s Caſe. But theſe ſeeming Diverſities will be reconciled by the following Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in <hi>Scott</hi> and <hi>Manby</hi>'s caſe.</p>

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:98535:123"/>3.

               <p>If the wife buys any thing, and it is found by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict that this is ſpent in the Houſhold; yet the husband without his actual aſſent, ſhall not be charged; ſo is 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 40. <hi>b.</hi> If my wife buy things to keep my Houſhold, as Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I do not know of this, and it is ſpent in my Houſe, I ſhall not be charged for it, <hi>Sid.</hi> 126. but the Employment to the Uſes of the husband, is good Evidence for the Jury to find that the husband <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> although it be not binding Evidence: As is the Caſe of a Factor, or Servant that buys Goods which come to the uſe of the Maſter, the Maſter ſhall be charged.

               <p>IN <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> the Plaintiff declares, where <hi>T.

               <p>The Defendant demurred in Law upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: Exception 1.<note place="margin">That Baron and Feme were ſeiſed, and ſhews not how the Eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> Becauſe he counts the Baron and Feme were ſeiſed to them, and the Heirs of the Baron, and ſheweth not how the Eſtate began; for it being a ſpecial Eſtate, and but a particular Eſtate in the wife, the Commencement of it ought to be ſhewed. <hi>Sed per Curiam,</hi> It's well enough, it being an Action on the Caſe by their Leſſee; ſo that it is but a Conveyance to the Action, and the Inheritance is in the husband. Exception 2. Becauſe he declares of a Leaſe by husband and wife by Indenture, and heweth not that a Rent was reſerved, and then it cannot be the Leaſe of the wife. But the Court held it to be good; for it is the Leaſe of the wife till ſhe diſagree, <hi>Cro. El.</hi> 112. <hi>Jackſon</hi> and <hi>Mordant.</hi>

                     <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Sect.</hi> 666. is a nice Caſe.

But in this Caſe if the Leſſor will ſue an Action of Waſte againſt the husband and his wife, for that the husband hath committed Waſte, the husband cannot bar the Leſſor by ſhewing this; that the taking back the Eſtate to him and his wife,<note place="margin">Remitter.</note> was a Remitter to the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98535:172"/> wife, becauſe the husband is eſtopt to ſay that which is againſt his own Feoffment. But if the husband make default to the grand Diſtreſs, and the wife pray to be received, ſhe may well ſhew the whole matter, and how ſhe is in her Remitter, and ſhe ſhall bar the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of his Action; for in every Caſe where the wife is received for default of her husband, ſhe ſhall plead, and have the ſame advantage in Pleading as if ſhe were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Action on the Statute of <hi>5 Eliz. c. 9.</hi> againſt the Husband and Wife for the Wife's not appearing <hi>ad Teſtificandum,</hi> and the Declaration of <hi>Polygamy</hi> againſt Stat. <hi>1 Jac. c. 11.</hi> Of ſtealing Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſtruction of the ſaid Statute, and of the Stat. <hi>39 Eliz. c. 8.</hi> Of Rape. Baron and Feme indicted of Perjury. Information againſt a Feme Covert for Selling Fiſh. In all Statutes which provide for actual Wrong, Femes Coverts ſhall be intended within them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> Brought an Action <hi>ſur Stat.</hi> 5 <hi>El. c.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">Upon the Stat. 5 <hi>El. c.</hi> 9. for not appearing <hi>ad Teſtificandum.</hi>

And ſhewed that Proceſs was ſerved upon the Defendant's wife, and ſufficient Charges, having regard to her Degree and Diſtance of the Place, &amp;c. tendered to her, and yet ſhe did not appear. Verdict <hi>pro Quer'.</hi> Moved in Arreſt of Judgment; 1. Becauſe the Plaintiff in ſetting forth he was damaged for the not appearance of the wife, and has not ſhewed how damnified. <hi>Reſpond'</hi> Though the Party be not at all damnified, yet the Penalty is forfeited. 2. A Feme Covert is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Statute, for no mention is made of a Feme Covert. <hi>Reſpond'.</hi> Femes Coverts are within the ſaid Statute, otherwiſe it would be a grand Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, for ſhe may be the only Witneſs. 3. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is, That the Plaintiff tendered the Charges to the wife, where he ought to have tendered the ſame
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:98535:188"/> to the husband. <hi>Reſpond'.</hi> The wife ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and therefore the Tender ought to be to her: And Judgment <hi>pro Quer',</hi> 1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 122. <hi>Havithlom</hi> and <hi>Harvey, Meſme</hi> Caſe, <hi>Cro. El.</hi> 130.</p>

                     <hi>Per Stat.</hi> 1 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 11. If any Perſon or Perſons within his Majeſty's Dominions of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> being married, do marry any Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the former wife being alive, that then every ſuch Offence ſhall be Felony, and the Perſon and Perſons ſo offending, ſhall ſuffer death, as in Caſes of Felony. But this Act ſhall not extend to husband or wife, being abſent ſeven years from the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. Nor ſhall it extend to any Perſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced at the time of ſuch Marriage in the Spiritual Court, nor to Marriage within the age of Conſent.</p>
                  <p>As to a Woman being divorced, and then marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again. It was one <hi>Porter</hi>'s Caſe: <hi>R.</hi> was lawfully eſpouſed to one <hi>Porter,</hi> and had ſued a Divorce <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Saevitiam,</hi> and it was <hi>Separamus a Menſa &amp; Thoro,</hi> but no word of <hi>Divorciamus.</hi> By the better Opinion ſhe is within the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and that it was not Felony; but it appeared by the Canons that ſuch Perſons as are divorced <hi>a Menſa &amp; Thoro,</hi> may not marry again; and it was clearly agreed by the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, that the ſecond Marriage was unlawful, and that ſhe might be in danger of the Statute; but it was not adjudged there: But in my Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi>'s Caſe ir was the Opinion, that they might marry again, <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 461. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Williams</hi> was indicted at <hi>Briſtol</hi> upon the Stat. 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 11. for having two Wives, and upon not guilty, a ſpecial Verdict was found that the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> married one wife, and was afterwards divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from her <hi>Cauſa Adulterii,</hi> and afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98535:188"/> the other; and if that were within the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of that Stat. which provides for thoſe who are divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, was the Queſtion. And it was reſolved without Argument by <hi>Bramſtone</hi> Chief Juſtice, and <hi>Heath, (caeteris abſentibus)</hi> that it is within the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> for the Statute ſpeaks generally of Divorces, and it is a Penal Law: And <hi>Heath</hi> ſaid that by the Law of Holy Church the Parties divorced <hi>Cauſa Adulterii,</hi> might marry; and he cited <hi>Porter</hi>'s Caſe, who was divorced <hi>Cauſa Saevitiae,</hi> and ſaid it was reſolved that that was not within the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> becauſe only a Divorce <hi>a Cohabitatione,</hi> and a Temporal Separation till the Anger paſt. But here it is <hi>a Vinculo Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii,</hi> (in which laſt he was much miſtaken) <hi>March Rep.</hi> 101.</p>
                  <p>One was indicted of Felony upon the Stat. 1 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 11. for having of two Wives; and the Evidence was, that he eſpouſed one beyond the Seas, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here; and the Court was of opinion that he was not within the Statute. <hi>Quaere,</hi> If the ſecond Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals were beyond the Seas, for that makes the Offence, and cannot here be tried, <hi>Sid.</hi> 171.</p>
                  <p>Councel on 1 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 11. prayed ſtay of Proceſs upon the Recognizance of the Proſecutor, who was bound over by Judge <hi>Archer,</hi> Judge of Aſſize in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to proſecute the Defendant for having two Wives; in regard he being taken in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> muſt be tried there, and that therefore it might be ſaved. But <hi>per Curiam,</hi> This being an Affirmative Statute, doth not take away the Trial by the Common Law where the Offence was committed, and agreed to ſave the Recognizance, <hi>Pengell</hi> and Dr. <hi>Eaton</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Keb.</hi> 31.</p>
